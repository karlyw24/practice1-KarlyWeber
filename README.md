writing down a to do list, start homework early, organize files on my computer


My name is Isabel Wheeler and I am studying statistics. I enjoy statistics because it can be applied to any field, so it gives me lots of flexibility with my career choice.

The three main things that I have been learning this semester is how to use R, a review of basic experimental design, and how to interpret children's literature in my English class.

The three most important things I use to organize my work is to make sure he files on my computer are organized, I keep track of all of my assignments in a planner, and I make sure to have canvas notifications on so that I can get updated information about assignments.
